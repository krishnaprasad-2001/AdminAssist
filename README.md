# AdminAssist

## Overview

AdminAssist is a powerful tool designed to assist server administrators and support technicians in troubleshooting WordPress installations and general server-related issues. Whether you're diagnosing a misconfigured website, fixing database errors, or analyzing server logs, AdminAssist provides quick and efficient solutions to streamline your workflow.

## Why AdminAssist?
- ‚úÖ Best for WordPress Troubleshooting ‚Äì Easily detect WordPress installations, check database connectivity, list installed themes, and fix common issues.
- ‚úÖ Automated Setup ‚Äì A simple installation script sets up everything in `/opt/AdminAssist`.
- ‚úÖ Modular Design ‚Äì Tasks are divided into separate scripts for better organization (e.g., `db.sh` for database management, `wp.sh` for WordPress-related tasks).
- ‚úÖ System Integration ‚Äì The installer creates a shortcut (`BK`) for easy execution from anywhere.

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/krishnaprasad-2001/AdminAssist.git
cd AdminAssist
```

### Run the Installer
```bash
chmod +x install.sh  
./install.sh
```

### Enable Auto-Completion (Optional)
To enable tab completion, run:
```bash
source /opt/AdminAssist/autoCompletion.sh
```

## Usage
Once installed, you can use AdminAssist through the `BK` command:
```bash
BK deb              # Check debug mode  
BK tdeb             # Toggle debug mode  
BK db               # Get database details  
BK upgrade          # Upgrade the WordPress installation  
BK theme            # List installed WordPress themes  
BK fix_db           # Fix database connectivity errors  
BK nginx            # View nginx error logs
BK apache           # View Apache error logs
BK add_custom_rule  # Assist in adding nginx custom Rule  
BK ipcheck          # Check if an ip is public or private
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Autocompletion Issue

We've noticed that **autocompletion isn't working as expected** when opening a new shell. It only works **after manually sourcing the completion file** using:

```bash
source /opt/AdminAssist/autoCompletion.sh
```

### üõ† What's Happening?
- The completion script **exists** but doesn't load automatically.
- It **only works when sourced manually**.

### ü§î Possible Causes:
- The completion script might not be in the correct location.
- The shell might not be loading it at startup.
- There could be an issue with how Bash is handling autocompletion.

### üîç Need Help!
